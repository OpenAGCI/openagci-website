I am a final-year undergraduate student at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), majoring in Artificial Intelligence (Honor Class). I will continue my study as a Ph.D. student at the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) under the supervision of Prof. Wanli Ouyang and Dr. Lei Bai. I am currently working as a research intern at the Shanghai AI Laboratory. My research interests lie in large language models (LLMs) and multi-agent systems (MAS).
